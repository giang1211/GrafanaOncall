## Set Up Grafana OnCall
Deploy and configure Grafana OnCall in the existing Grafana instance. DONE

Ensure authentication and user access follow existing security policies (SSO or role-based access control).
Need to ask: Is Grafana already using LDAP or SSO for login? If yes, are user roles (Admin/Editor/Viewer) assigned automatically via group mappings or SSO claims?
